# ComfyStore
A place to buy furniture and all home decor items. [Live Project Link](https://famous-crepe-3b11c7.netlify.app/)
## Why?
I built this project to learn and play with all new react router and redux features.
Also styled whole website with tailwind css and daisy ui, which significantly reduced time I need when I use vanilla css. 
## Quick Start
- To run this project on your own device, just download all files from github and extract them.
- Open files in your favourite code editor and in terminal run following commands:
  `npm install && npm run dev`
